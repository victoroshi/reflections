How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It save a lot of my time by pointing to the line where addition or omission occurs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can easily revert to the last successful operation. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
The pro is that you are commiting at the right time without system beiing automatically do the committing which can cluster the system. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
This is to enable the update to be consistent. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
type git log to see the list of commits and git diff to see the differences
