When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when many changes has been made on a project that others are also working on.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid unneccesary commit at frequent intervals

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is used when we need to modify a repository that we dont have access. Clone is used to transfer repository to our local machine while branches are used to create new file that we can join later together
